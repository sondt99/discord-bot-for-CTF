# Discord CTF Bot

A Discord bot for organizing Capture The Flag competitions. It integrates with CTFtime to fetch events, creates per-event categories and channels, tracks challenges with threads, and polls live scoreboards for CTFd and rCTF platforms.

## Features

- **CTFtime integration** — browse and join upcoming CTF events with pagination
- **Challenge management** — create threads per challenge, track solved/open status, ping `@ctf` role on creation
- **Live scoreboard** — periodic polling with change notifications for CTFd and rCTF
- **Message statistics** — per-user leaderboard, activity breakdown, and historical backfill
- **Multi-event support** — run multiple CTFs simultaneously, each with its own category
- **Role-based access** — `@ctf` role members can mark challenges as solved; admin commands remain admin-only
- **Audit logging** — automatic private `BOT` category with command logs and database backups

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- Discord bot token with the [required intents](#permissions)

# 1. Clone and configure
cp .env.example .env

## Workflow

```
1. /ctf join <event_id>          → Bot creates category with topic channels
2. Go to a topic channel (rev, pwn, web, ...)
3. /challenge <name>             → Bot creates a thread and pings @ctf
4. Work on the challenge in the thread
5. /done @solver                 → Mark solved, thread renamed to [DONE]
6. /challenges                   → Overview with clickable thread links
```

## Channels Created on Join

Each CTF event gets a Discord category named after the event, containing:

```
account       — read-only info channel
general       — general discussion
rev           — reverse engineering
pwn           — binary exploitation
web           — web challenges
crypto        — cryptography
for           — forensics
misc          — miscellaneous
scoreboard    — live scoreboard updates
```

## BOT Admin Category

On startup, the bot creates a private `BOT` category visible only to admins:

- **#log** — command usage logs
- **#backup** — database backup after each slash command invocation

## Permissions

The bot requires these Discord permissions:

| Permission | Reason |
|---|---|
| Manage Channels | Create categories, channels, and threads |
| Create Public Threads | Challenge threads |
| Read Message History | `/stats sync` backfill |
| Send Messages | Thread creation and responses |
| Embed Links | All bot responses use embeds |
| Manage Roles | (Optional) if you want the bot to manage the `@ctf` role |

**Required intents** (enable in the Discord Developer Portal):

- Server Members
- Message Content (if using prefix commands in the future)

## Notes

- The `@ctf` role must be created manually in your server for the challenge ping and `/done` access to work.
- Message statistics only track messages sent after the bot is deployed, unless you run `/stats sync`.
- Scoreboard polling for rCTF uses the public API directly — no browser dependency required.
- The bot uses SQLite. For production use, ensure the database file is on a persistent volume.
